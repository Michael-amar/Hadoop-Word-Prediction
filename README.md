# How to run

Generate Jars for steps 1-6 or download them from **_s3://distributed-systems-assignment-2/_**

Run the attached jar as follows:

``` java -jar jarname.jar s3_bucket_name```

Await output at ```s3://distributed-systems-assignment-2/output/```

# Steps:

### Step1 counts 3-grams:
<pre style="max-height: 450px;">
<u>Mapper Input:</u>
< danny went home> 1991 5 ...
< danny went home> 1992 4 ...
< danny went bowling> 1991 3
< danny went bowling> 1992 4


<u>Mapper Output</u>:
< danny went home> 5
< danny went home> 4


<u>Reducer Input</u>:
< danny went bowling> [3,4]
< danny went home> [5,4]


<u>Reducer Output</u>:
< danny went bowling> 7
< danny went home> 9

</pre>

### Step 2 counts 1-grams:
<pre style="max-height: 450px;">

Gets step 1's output

<u>Mapper Input:</u>
< danny went bowling> 7
< danny went home> 9


<u>Mapper Output</u>:
< * > 21
< danny > 7
< went > 7
< bowling > 7
< * > 27
< danny > 9
< went > 9
< home > 9


<u>Reducer Input</u>:
< * > [21,27]
< bowling > [7]
< danny > [7,9]
< home > [9]
< went > [7,9]


<u>Reducer Output</u>:
< * > 48
< bowling > 7
< danny > 16
< home > 9
< went > 16

</pre>

### step 3
<pre style="max-height: 450px;">
Gets step 1's output 

And loads the 1-gram table into memory


<u>Mapper Input:</u>
< danny went bowling > 7
< danny went home > 9


<u>Mapper Output</u>:
< danny went > < * > 7
< danny went > < danny went bowling > 7
< danny went > < * > 9
< danny went > < danny went home > 9


<u>Reducer Input</u>:
< danny went > < * > [7,9]
< danny went > < danny went bowling > 7
< danny went > < danny went home > 9


<u>Reducer Output</u>:
< danny went bowling>  &nbsp;&nbsp; k<sub>3</sub> * <frac>N<sub>3</sub>/C<sub>2</sub>
< danny went home >  &nbsp;&nbsp;k<sub>3</sub> * <frac>N<sub>3</sub>/C<sub>2</sub>

</pre>

### step 4
<pre style="max-height: 450px;">

Gets step 1's output 

And loads the 1-gram table into memory


<u>Mapper Input:</u>
< danny went bowling > 7
< danny went home > 9


<u>Mapper Output</u>:
< went bowling>  < * > 7
< went bowling > < danny went bowling > 7 
< went home > < * > 9
< went home > < danny went home > 9


<u>Reducer Input</u>:
< went bowling>  < * > 7
< went bowling > < danny went bowling > 7 
< went home > < * > 9
< went home > < danny went home > 9


<u>Reducer Output</u>:
< danny went bowling >  &nbsp; &nbsp; (1-k<sub>3</sub>)*k<sub>2</sub>* (N<sub>2</sub> / C<sub>1(went</sub>))  + (1-k<sub>3</sub>)*(1-k<sub>2</sub>)*(N<sub>bowling</sub> / C<sub>0</sub>)
< danny went home >  &nbsp; &nbsp;(1-k<sub>3</sub>)*k<sub>2</sub>* (N<sub>2</sub> / C<sub>1(went</sub>))  + (1-k<sub>3</sub>)*(1-k<sub>2</sub>)*(N<sub>home</sub> / C<sub>0</sub>)

</pre>


### step 5
<pre style="max-height: 450px;">
Sums step 3 and 4 

<u>Mapper Input:</u>
< danny went bowling >  &nbsp; &nbsp; (1-k<sub>3</sub>)*k<sub>2</sub>* (N<sub>2</sub> / C<sub>1(went</sub>))  + (1-k<sub>3</sub>)*(1-k<sub>2</sub>)*(N<sub>bowling</sub> / C<sub>0</sub>)
< danny went home >  &nbsp; &nbsp;(1-k<sub>3</sub>)*k<sub>2</sub>* (N<sub>2</sub> / C<sub>1(went</sub>))  + (1-k<sub>3</sub>)*(1-k<sub>2</sub>)*(N<sub>home</sub> / C<sub>0</sub>)
< danny went bowling>  &nbsp;&nbsp; k<sub>3</sub> * <frac>N<sub>3</sub>/C<sub>2</sub>
< danny went home >  &nbsp;&nbsp;k<sub>3</sub> * <frac>N<sub>3</sub>/C<sub>2</sub>


<u>Mapper Output</u>:(Identity)
< danny went bowling >  &nbsp; &nbsp; (1-k<sub>3</sub>)*k<sub>2</sub>* (N<sub>2</sub> / C<sub>1(went</sub>))  + (1-k<sub>3</sub>)*(1-k<sub>2</sub>)*(N<sub>bowling</sub> / C<sub>0</sub>)
< danny went home >  &nbsp; &nbsp;(1-k<sub>3</sub>)*k<sub>2</sub>* (N<sub>2</sub> / C<sub>1(went</sub>))  + (1-k<sub>3</sub>)*(1-k<sub>2</sub>)*(N<sub>home</sub> / C<sub>0</sub>)
< danny went bowling>  &nbsp;&nbsp; k<sub>3</sub> * <frac>N<sub>3</sub>/C<sub>2</sub>
< danny went home >  &nbsp;&nbsp;k<sub>3</sub> * <frac>N<sub>3</sub>/C<sub>2</sub>


<u>Reducer Input</u>:
< danny went bowling >  [ term1, term2+term3]
< danny went home >  [ term1, term2+term3]


<u>Reducer Output</u>:
< danny went bowling >  term1+term2+term3]
< danny went home >  term1+term2+term3
